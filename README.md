## Known B*r*u*h*gs

_(sorted by priority)_

1. `TypeError: Cannot read property X of undefined` on new Spawn.
1. `TypeError: Cannot read property 'run' of undefined` on creeps with unlisted role.
1. Complete halt of the code if an error occurs _(mainly due to the first two errors)_.
1. `collector` role takes the energy out of the storage and immediately puts it back.

## What can you do?

- Try to accomplish one of the non-completed things from the TODO list
- Have more idieas to the TODO list? Great!
- Try to fix bugs that are on known bugs list
- Found a bug? Add it to the list of known bugs
- Found a high CPU cost code and know how to optimize it? Great!

**_any help would be appreciated_**
