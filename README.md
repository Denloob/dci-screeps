*(sorted by priority)*
1. `TypeError: Cannot read property X of undefined` on new Spawn.
1. `TypeError: Cannot read property 'run' of undefined` on creeps with unlisted role.
1. Complete halt of the code if an error occurs *(mainly due to the first two errors)*.
1. `collector` role takes the energy out of the storage and immediately puts it back.
## What can you do?
* Try to accomplish one of the non-completed things from the TODO list
* Have more idieas to the TODO list? Great!
* Try to fix bugs that are on known bugs list
* Found a bug? Add it to the list of known bugs
* Found a high CPU cost code and know how to optimize it? Great!

__*any help would be appreciated*__
